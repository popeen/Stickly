# What is Stickly
A very simple sticky note application that will always show on top of other applications

# Installation
For now you have to compile it yourself to run it. I plan on creating a release and add it to WinGet soon, I just want to test it a bit first to avoid any potential issues.

# Screenshots

The default look is using a fully configurable custom titlebar

If you really want to you can disable this in the config file and use a standard winforms titlebar instead
